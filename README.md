# Slay the Spire Archive Site

The goal here is to create a very basic site for sharing *Slay the Spireâ„¢* run
files.

My motivation was the realization that the data made great filler data for
prototyping other charts. It was information that I was already familiar with,
and it can help me become a little bit better at not dying.

## Goals

- [ ] Build the backend for a very basic site for simple, file-based sharing
- [ ] Integrate a database for more dynamic data analysis and for faster
  downloads
- [ ] Build a user friendly frontend
